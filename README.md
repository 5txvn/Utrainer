## **What is Utrainer?**
*Utrainer is a website meant to serve as a host of UIL training materials for various different subject areas, such as the UIL math events, science, computer science, etc.*
## **Setup**
Firstly, make sure that you have the most recent version of Node.js installed on your system. Once you do that, clone the repository using the following command
```
git clone https://github.com/5txvn/Utrainer.git
```
Then, go into this directory and run the following:
```
npm install
```
Now all the required packages should be installed and you can run the following command to launch the server:
```
node index
```
Once you do this, the server will be hosted at **localhost:3000**, and then everything should be just fine to use from there.
